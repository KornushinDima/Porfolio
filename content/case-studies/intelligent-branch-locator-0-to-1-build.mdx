Case Study: Intelligent Branch Locator (0 to 1 Build)

Role: Lead Product Designer Project Type: New Product Development (Greenfield) Core Challenge: Designing a unified search engine for physical banking assets ("Points") and service centers ("Locations").

1. The Problem: "The Search Gap"

Financial institutions previously treated their location finders as static directories. Users could find an address, but they lacked contextual visibility.

The User Pain Point: A user would drive to a branch specifically for an appointment, only to find no on-site parking or that the specific service they needed wasn't available there.

The Data Gap: There was no distinction between a full-service branch and a standalone utility (like an off-site ATM).

The "Blind" Arrival: Users had no visibility into how busy a branch was before leaving their house.

2. Strategic Definition: Defining the Data Model

Since we were building from scratch, my first task was defining what a user is actually searching for. Working with the product team, we established two distinct entity types to power the design:

Locations (Service-Based): Physical branches with staff, bookable appointments, and queues.

Points (Feature-Based): Location-based entities without services or staff (e.g., stand-alone ATMs, Kiosks).

Key Design Requirement: The system needed a unified map interface that could gracefully handle both types simultaneously without confusing the user.

3. The Solution: A Dynamic "Filter-First" Map

Feature 1: "Location Features" & Granular Filtering

The Concept: We moved beyond simple address search. We introduced "Location Features"—attributes that act as clickable filters.

The Design: Users can toggle specific amenities such as "Extended Hours," "On-site Parking," or "Drive-Thru."

The Value: This empowers the user to plan their trip based on logistics, not just proximity.

Feature 2: Conditional Search Logic (The "Smart" Flow)

One of the biggest UX challenges was handling the interaction between Booking and Browsing. I designed a conditional logic flow to prevent errors:

Scenario A (Browsing): If the user is just searching the map, we display both Branches ("Locations") and ATMs ("Points").

Scenario B (Booking): If the user selects a specific service first (e.g., "Mortgage Consultation"), the system automatically filters out "Points" (ATMs) from the results.

Why: A user cannot book a mortgage appointment at an ATM. This auto-filtering removes friction and prevents dead-end clicks.

Feature 3: Lobby Integration (Real-Time Wait Times)

The Integration: We connected the Branch Locator UI to the Coconut Lobby product.

The UI: Branch cards on the map display live "Estimated Wait Times" for services.

The Impact: This manages expectations before the client arrives. A user sees "15 min wait" and can decide to join the virtual queue immediately or book an appointment for later.

4. Design Details (Portfolio Highlights)

A. The "Point" vs. "Location" Visuals

I created distinct pin systems. "Locations" (Branches) are interactive and expandable, showing staff availability and wait times. "Points" (ATMs) are lightweight, showing only distance and navigation details.

B. The Admin Perspective (Service Blueprint)

To make this frontend work, I had to design the admin requirements where Managers can associate specific "Tags" (Features) to specific locations. This ensures the frontend filters are always accurate.

5. The Outcome

We successfully launched an "Add-on" feature that transformed the client's website from a static directory into a real-time operational tool.

Enhanced Discovery: Clients can now find "Hidden" assets (like specific off-site ATMs) that were previously buried in text lists.

Reduced Friction: The conditional logic (hiding Points when booking services) significantly reduced "failed booking" attempts.

Operational Transparency: Displaying wait times leveled the load across branches, as users self-distributed to less busy locations.
