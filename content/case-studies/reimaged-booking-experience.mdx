Case Study: Reimaged Booking Experience

Role: Product Designer | Company: Coconut Software | Timeline: 2 Weeks (Design Sprint + Hackathon)

## Executive Summary

The existing booking flow at Coconut Software was suffering from high friction. Users were forced through a rigid, linear process that required excessive back-and-forth navigation to find available slots across different locations.

During a focused Design Sprint and Hackathon, we moved away from a static "stepper" interface to an Agentic UI. We introduced intelligent "Find Time" logic, virtual queuing ("Join the Line"), and video appointment integration, significantly reducing the cognitive load required to book an appointment.

## The Problem: "The Navigation Ping-Pong"

The Challenge: Customer feedback and analytics revealed that the Time-to-Book metric was too high. The core issues were:

Location/Availability Disconnect: Users would select a location, only to find no suitable times were available. To check a different location, they had to navigate back several steps, resetting their progress.

Decision Fatigue: The linear process placed the burden of discovery entirely on the user.

Rigidity: There was no easy way to opt for virtual appointments or immediate queuing if a specific slot wasn't available.

### The User Voice:

"It takes too long to find a needed slot. I feel like I am playing ping-pong going back and forth between locations just to see who is free."

## The Process: Sprint & Hackathon

To solve this complex interaction problem quickly, we utilized a Design Sprint methodology leading into a company Hackathon.

Discovery: We mapped the current user journey and identified the "friction points" where drop-offs occurred.

Ideation: We hypothesized that an Agentic UI—where the interface proactively helps the user achieve their goal rather than just presenting static options—would solve the navigation issue.

Prototyping: We moved from wireframes to high-fidelity prototypes to test the logic of the "Find Time" algorithm.

## The Solution: Moving to Agentic UI

We redesigned the flow to be "outcome-oriented" rather than "step-oriented."

### The Agentic Interface

Instead of forcing the user to browse, the interface now acts as an agent.

How it works: The system accepts the user's intent (e.g., "I need a loan renewal next week") and intelligently scans all available locations and staff simultaneously.

The Benefit: This eliminated the "back button." The system presents the best options across all variables instantly.

### "Find Time" Functionality

We introduced a smart filtering system.

The Logic: Rather than browsing a blank calendar, users can toggle "First Available" or specific time blocks (e.g., "Mornings").

Result: This reduced the number of clicks required to secure a slot by bypassing the visual scan of a monthly calendar.

### Flexibility: "Join the Line" & Video

To accommodate users who couldn't find a future slot or needed immediate service, we added two critical entry points:

Join the Line: A virtual queuing system for walk-ins/immediate service, removing the need to physically wait in a lobby.

Join Over Video: If a physical location was fully booked, the system suggests a video appointment as an alternative, balancing the load across staff.

## The Impact & Key Learnings

### Outcomes (Projected/Observed during Hackathon):

Reduced Friction: The number of steps to book a standard appointment was reduced by ~40%.

Error Prevention: "No slots available" dead-ends were virtually eliminated by the Agentic suggestions.

Reflection: This project highlighted the power of Agentic Design in complex logistics. By shifting the burden of "search" from the human to the system, we transformed a frustrating administrative task into a helpful, conversational experience.
