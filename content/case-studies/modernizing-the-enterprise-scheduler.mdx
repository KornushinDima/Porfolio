Case Study: Modernizing the Enterprise Scheduler

Project: Core Schedule Redesign (Vertical & Timeline Views) Role: Product Designer Context: Appointment Scheduling & Lobby Management for Financial Institutions

1. The Challenge

Financial advisors and branch managers spend 6-8 hours a day inside the Coconut schedule. The legacy interface was functional but suffered from:

Cognitive Overload: Dense grids and lack of hierarchy made it hard to distinguish between "Walk-ins," "Appointments," and "Breaks."

Legacy UI: The visual style felt dated (spreadsheet-like), lowering perceived value compared to modern SaaS tools.

Accessibility Risks: Many financial institutions require strict WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for their internal tools, which the old grid struggled to meet (specifically contrast and screen reader navigation).

2. The Solution: Dual-View Architecture

To support different personas (The Advisor vs. The Branch Manager), we introduced a seamless toggle between two distinct views.

A. Vertical View (The "My Day" Focus)

Target User: Financial Advisors / Loan Officers.

Goal: Deep focus on personal schedule and appointment details.

# Design Shift:

Moved from a cramped table to Time-Block Cards.

"Lobby Integration": Added a dedicated "Waiting Room" drawer on the side so advisors can see who has arrived without leaving their daily view.

Modern Look: Used subtle drop-shadows to give "lift" to current appointments, separating them from the background grid.

B. Horizontal Timeline View (The "Air Traffic Control" Focus)

Target User: Branch Managers / Greeters.

Goal: Resource allocation—seeing gaps across 10-20 staff members to slot in walk-in customers.

# Design Shift:

Infinite X-Axis Scroll: Placed staff names sticky on the left (Y-axis) with time flowing horizontally.

Gap Visualization: Designed "Empty States" (white space) to be active drop-zones. A manager can drag a "Walk-in Customer" ticket directly into a white space to book it instantly.

3. Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) as a Feature

Since Coconut serves banks, accessibility is a compliance requirement, not just a nice-to-have.

# Keyboard Navigation (Power Users):

![Placeholder Image](/images/placeholder.jpg)

Bank tellers often prefer keyboards over mice. We implemented a Roving Tab Index.

Interaction: Arrow keys move focus between time slots. Enter opens the booking modal. Spacebar toggles selection.

# Color Independence (WCAG 1.4.1):

![Placeholder Image](/images/placeholder.jpg)

Problem: Relying on color (e.g., Green = Confirmed, Red = Cancelled) fails for colorblind users.

Solution: We added Status Icons (a checkmark, a warning sign, a clock) inside the appointment cards alongside the color coding.

# High Contrast Grid:

Standardized grid lines to meet the 3:1 contrast ratio against the background, ensuring the structure is visible on older, low-quality bank monitors.

4. The "Modern Look" (UI Polish)

To move away from the "Excel" look, we applied specific UI refinements:

Zebra Striping Removal: Replaced old-school alternating grey rows with "Hover Guides." The row/column only highlights when the mouse is active over it, reducing visual noise by 80% when the user is just reading.

Typography: Switched to a tabular-numeral font (monospaced numbers) for times, ensuring 10:00 and 11:00 align perfectly vertically, creating a clean scannable rhythm.

Current Time Indicator: Replaced the harsh red line with a "Pill & Gradient" indicator—a softer, branded visual that floats above the grid to show exact progression.

5. Results & Impact

Reduced Booking Time: "Drag-and-drop" on the Horizontal view reduced the time to assign a walk-in customer by ~40%.

Compliance Achieved: Passed 3rd-party accessibility audit for WCAG 2.1 AA, unblocking contracts with Tier 1 banks.

User Feedback: "The new horizontal view makes it impossible to double-book my staff during lunch hours." — Pilot Branch Manager.
