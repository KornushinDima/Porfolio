Case Study: Virtual In-Branch Experience

Project: Bridging the gap between rural branches and city expertise for Coconut Software. Role: Product Designer Tools: Figma, Jira, [Insert other tools]

1. The Challenge

The Problem: Financial institutions with rural branches often struggle to staff specialists (e.g., mortgage advisors, wealth managers) at every location. Customers in these areas faced long wait times, limited service hours, or the burden of travelling to major cities for appointments.

The Opportunity: Coconut Software needed a "Virtual In-Branch" solution. The goal was to allow a customer to walk into a rural branch and be served instantly via video by a specialist sitting in a city hub or working from home, utilizing an existing office or "virtual pod" in the branch.

2. Discovery & Requirements

To understand the constraints, we identified two distinct user groups with competing needs:

The Rural Customer: often less tech-savvy, values privacy, and expects the "in-person" feeling of a branch visit.

The Remote Staff Member: Needs a seamless way to identify which "room" the customer is in and control the session remotely.

# Key Requirements:

Hardware/Room Integration: How does the software talk to the hardware in the branch room?

Queue Visibility: Updating the Staff Dashboard to distinguish between "Physical Walk-ins" and "Virtual In-Branch" tickets.

The Interface: A high-fidelity video interface that handles document sharing.

3. The Solution

We designed a three-part ecosystem to bridge the physical and digital gap.

A. The "Virtual Room" Experience (Customer View)

Zero-Friction Entry: We designed the in-room interface to require zero login from the customer. Once the branch greeter checks them in, the screen in the room welcomes them by name.

Privacy First: Designed a "Privacy Mode" toggle on the video interface, allowing customers to blank the screen if they needed to sign physical papers or handle cash, mimicking a closed door.

B. The Queue Management Dashboard Update (Staff View)

Unified View: I redesigned the queue cards to include a "Location" tag. Staff can now see: John Doe - Wealth Mgmt (Room 4 - Rural Branch A) alongside their standard tickets.

Remote Room Control: Added functionality for the staff member to "Unlock" the room and initiate the call from their dashboard, preventing customers from staring at an empty video feed.

C. The Video Interface

Document Collaboration: Since financial meetings require heavy paperwork, the video interface prioritizes screen sharing and document co-signing over the video feed itself when necessary.

4. Design Process & Iterations

Wireframing the Hybrid Flow: [Insert Image: Flowchart showing the customer journey from walking in the door to the video call ending].

Friction Points: Early testing showed staff were confused about where the customer was.

Iteration: We added a "Room Status" indicator to the dashboard (e.g., Occupied, Ready for Call, Empty) to prevent staff from dialing into an empty room.

5. The Impact

Increased Utilization: Allowed city-based staff to fill downtime by serving rural queues.

Reduced Wait Times: Rural customers saw a decrease in wait times for specialist appointments.

Scalability: The design allowed branches to turn any office into a "service hub" without expensive hardware upgrades.
