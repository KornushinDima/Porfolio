# Case Study: Eliminating Double-Bookings with "Find Time" Logic

**Project:** Coconut Software Appointment Modal
**Role:** Product Designer
**Focus:** UI/UX Design, Interaction Design, Prototyping, Usability Testing

## 1. Executive Summary

At Coconut Software, scheduling is the core product. However, the existing "Create Appointment" modal had a critical flaw: it allowed users to book slots without validating staff availability, particularly when booking on behalf of multiple staff members.

I designed a "Find Time" feature—integrated directly into the booking modal—that visualizes team availability and prevents double-booking. This feature reduced scheduling conflicts and improved the user's confidence in the booking process.

## 2. Discovery: Quantifying the Friction

The core friction occurred when users tried to book appointments involving multiple staff members (e.g., a Financial Advisor and a Mortgage Specialist) from pages outside the main calendar view.

To validate this, I analyzed user feedback collected via Pendo. By running the raw feedback through an AI script, I categorized support tickets and open-text responses to identify recurring themes.

**The Pain Points Identified:**
*   **No Visibility:** The booking modal was isolated from the calendar.
*   **The "Any Slot" Error:** Users could technically select any time slot, even if staff were busy.
*   **Double Booking:** This required manual rescheduling and caused frustration for the end customer.

> **User Insight:** "I have to open three different tabs just to see if everyone is free, then go back to the modal to book it. If I guess, I usually get it wrong."

## 3. The Challenge

How might we allow users to book complex, multi-staff appointments from anywhere in the application without creating scheduling conflicts?

## 4. The Solution: "Find Time"

Inspired by best-in-class scheduling tools but adapted for our specific B2B use case, I introduced a "Find Time" functionality within the modal.

**Key Features:**
*   **On-Demand Availability:** Users click "Find Time" to expand a drawer, keeping the initial UI clean.
*   **Visual Comparison:** The view aggregates the calendars of all selected staff members side-by-side.
*   **Smart Filtering:** The system highlights "Common Free Slots"—times where all selected participants are available.
*   **Conflict Prevention:** If a user attempts to force a booking during a busy slot, the UI provides a warning.

## 5. Validation & Usability Testing

We needed to validate that the "Find Time" interaction flow was intuitive before development.

**Recruitment Strategy**
To ensure we were testing with the right people, I used Pendo to deploy a targeted in-app banner. We specifically segmented for "Power Users" who had attempted multi-staff bookings in the last 30 days.

**Testing with Maze**
I conducted unmoderated testing using Maze with 5 internal Customer Success Managers and 3 external power users recruited via the banner.

**Findings & Iterations:**
*   **Issue:** Initially, the "Find Time" button was too subtle. Maze heatmaps showed users trying to manually input dates first.
*   **Fix:** I increased the visual prominence of the button and placed it adjacent to the date picker.
*   **Issue:** Users were confused by "Partial Availability" (where 1 of 2 staff were free).
*   **Fix:** We added clear color coding: Green (All available), Yellow (Partial), Red (None).

## 6. The Final Design

The final design allows a user to initiate a booking from a client's profile, add three different staff members, hit "Find Time," and instantly see the only 30-minute slot available that week.

*   **Efficiency:** Eliminated the need to open multiple browser tabs to check schedules.
*   **Accuracy:** Reduced the margin for human error to near zero.

## 7. Results & Reflections

The introduction of the "Find Time" feature significantly improved the administrative experience.

*   **Outcome:** Drastically reduced the rate of accidental double-bookings for multi-staff appointments.
*   **Takeaway:** Context is king. When designing for complex data (like calendars), you cannot rely on simple form fields. You must visualize the data at the moment of decision-making.
