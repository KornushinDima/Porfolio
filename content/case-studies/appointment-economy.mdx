# The Challenge
The "Velvet Rope" model is broken. High-value clients arriving for life-changing mortgage appointments were getting stuck behind lines of people needing quick teller services. This "operational blindness" caused high abandonment rates and deep user anxiety.

# The Solution
We moved from anecdotal complaints to data-driven solutions using the Double Diamond framework. The result was a Service Ecosystem comprising three distinct parts:
1. **The Intelligent Kiosk (Input):** A "Language-First" routing system that triages walk-ins and allows users to join a virtual queue via SMS.
2. **Lobby TV (Feedback):** A digital status board using automated rotation logic and estimated wait times to validate the user's presence and reduce anxiety.
3. **Staff Dashboard (Triage):** A "God-mode" interface integrated with Salesforce/CRM, allowing managers to drag-and-drop unassigned customers and prepare for appointments in advance.

# Impact & Results
- **66%** Reduced Wait Times (from 1 hour to \<20 mins at Arvest Bank)
- **$1.6M** Revenue Increase (Bank of New Hampshire)
- **3X** Higher Conversion on booked appointments vs. walk-ins
