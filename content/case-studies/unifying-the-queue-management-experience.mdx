Case Study: Unifying the Queue Management Experience

Project: Queue Management System Redesign | Role: Product Designer | Company: Coconut Software

1. Executive Summary

We redesigned the core Queue Management System to address critical workflow fragmentation. By consolidating two disconnected interfaces ("Lobby" and "Dashboard") into a single, cohesive experience, we significantly reduced click depth, eliminated context switching, and improved overall consistency for tellers and branch managers.

2. The Challenge

The Split Workflow The legacy system forced users to toggle between two distinct environments to complete basic tasks:

The Lobby: Used strictly for checking in customers (Teller view).

The Dashboard: Used for managing the broader queue and upcoming appointments.

The Friction

High Interaction Cost: Users had to constantly switch tabs/pages to get a full picture of the branch status, leading to "click fatigue."

Inconsistency: The visual patterns and UI components differed between the Lobby and Dashboard, increasing the cognitive load for new employees.

Lack of Agility: Tellers could not easily adjust appointments on the fly without leaving their primary workspace.

Problem Statement: How might we streamline the queue management workflow so that tellers and managers can view, edit, and action appointments in a single, consistent interface?

3. Discovery & Research

We didn't just guess at the problem; we went to the source.

Branch Visits: We conducted site visits to observe tellers in their natural environment. We watched them struggle to navigate between tabs while a customer was waiting in front of them, highlighting the pressure of the "back and forth."

User Feedback Loops: We analyzed support tickets and feedback logs which consistently flagged "too many clicks" as a major frustration.

Key Insight: Users view "Checking In" and "Managing the Queue" as one continuous workflow, not two separate administrative tasks. The software needed to reflect this mental model.

4. The Solution: A Unified Dashboard

We moved away from the segregated Lobby/Dashboard model and created a unified Queue Management Interface.

# Key Design Improvements:

Single View Architecture: We consolidated the functionality. Tellers can now see the queue status and perform check-ins from the same screen.

Contextual Actions: Instead of navigating away to edit an appointment, we introduced slide-outs or inline editing, allowing users to make changes without losing their place in the queue.

Visual Consistency: We applied a standardized design system across the interface, ensuring buttons, status indicators, and typography were predictable and accessible.

5. The Outcome

The redesign transformed the daily operations for branch staff.

Reduced Friction: Drastically lowered the number of clicks required to process a customer from arrival to service.

Improved Usability: Feedback from beta testing indicated that new tellers found the unified system easier to learn.

Operational Efficiency: Eliminated the latency caused by switching between the Lobby and Dashboard views.
